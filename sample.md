# This is my markdown previewer
## I have used pure JS, HTML and CSS to build it
### Here is how it works!

You write markdown inside of editor and it gets converted into regular text and shown inside of preview box. It is commonly used in forums.

It can make your text __bold__, 
or you want some *italic styling*.
Strikethough looks ~~like this~~.

> You can add blockquote!

You want a code block?!
```javascript
const array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function squareNums(arr) {
    return arr.map(e => Math.pow(e, 2));
}

console.log(squareNums(array))
```
Unordered list:
* first
* second
* nesting
    * nested
    * you want more nesting?
        * more nested
        * MOREE!!
            * no more nesting!

Ordered list:
1. First
1. Second
1. Just adding number 1 

Inline code goes between backticks `const code = new Array(5).fill('a')`.
